<p>
    Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that is played by two players taking turns
    placing X's and O's in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three
    of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
    If all 9 cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends
    in a tie.
